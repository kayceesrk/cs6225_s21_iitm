## Course Objectives

This course is about an approach to bringing software engineering up to speed
with more traditional engineering disciplines, **providing a mathematical
foundation for rigorous analysis of realistic computer systems**. As civil
engineers apply their mathematical canon to reach high certainty that bridges
will not fall down, the software engineer should apply a different canon to
argue that programs behave properly. 

As other engineering disciplines have their computer-aided-design tools,
computer science has proof assistants, IDEs for logical arguments and
solver-aided languages that automatically verify logical arguments. We will
learn how to apply these tools to certify that programs behave as expected.

Specifically, we will look at

1. Formal logical reasoning about program correctness through
2. [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/), a tool for machine checked
   mathematical theorem proving and
3. [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org), a general-purpose programming language
   aimed at program verification

**Is this a program verification course?** 

Yes, but let's stick to [Program
Proofs](https://blog.sigplan.org/2019/09/12/program-verification-has-it-lost-its-punch/).

## Course Contents 

* **Foundations:** Induction principles, logic and propositions, Curry-Howard
  correspondence.

* **Proving with F\*:** Verifying Stateful Programs – Dijkstra Monad - Higher
  Kinds, Indexed Types, Type-level functions – Cryptography examples - Verifying
  low-level code using Low\*, a subset of F\*

## Pre-requisite

[CS3100](http://kcsrk.info/cs3100_f19/) (only the OCaml parts) or equivalent. 

You should feel comfortable with functional programming concepts. If you are
able to get through the assignments 1 to 4, you are ready for this course. All
the course materials, and assignments are available on the [CS3100
website](http://kcsrk.info/cs3100_f19/). 

**I highly recommend that you complete assignments 1 to 4 before the start of
this course**.

If you are unsure, please come talk to me.
