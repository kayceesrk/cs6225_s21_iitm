(* If we [either] an [option] value with [None]
 * on the right, it leaves that value unchanged,
 * (just as if we put the [None] on the left).
 * This is analogous to how appending [nil]
 * on either side of a list leaves it unchanged.
 *)
Theorem either_None_right : forall {A} (xo : option A),
    either xo None = xo.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* [either] is associative, just like [++].

Theorem either_assoc : forall {A} (xo yo zo : option A),
    either (either xo yo) zo = either xo (either yo zo).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* [head] should compute the head of a list, that is,
 * it should return [Some] with the first element of
 * the list if the list is nonempty, and [None]
 * if the list is empty.

    head (xs ++ ys) = either (head xs) (head ys).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* [leftmost_Node] should compute the leftmost node of
 * a tree.
 *
 * Please implement [leftmost_Node] directly using
 * recursion (i.e., pattern matching) on the [tree] argument,
 * without using the [flatten] operation.
 *)
Fixpoint leftmost_Node {A} (t : tree A) : option A.
Admitted.

Example leftmost_Node_example :
    leftmost_Node (Node (Node Leaf 2 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)) 1 Leaf)
    = Some 2.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Prove that the leftmost node of the tree is the same
 * as the head of the list produced by flattening the tree
 * with an in-order traversal.
 *)
Theorem leftmost_Node_head : forall {A} (t : tree A),
      leftmost_Node t = head (flatten t).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Now let's work with the binary tries we defined earlier!
 *
 * Define [lookup] such that [lookup k t] looks up the
 * map entry corresponding to the key [k : list bool] in the
 * binary trie [t : binary_trie A], interpreting [t] such that
 * the value at the root of [t] corresponds to the
 * entry for the key [nil], the left subtree contains entries
 * for those keys that begin with [true], and the right subtree
 * contains entries for those keys that begin with [false].

Proof.

(* [Leaf] represents an empty binary trie, so a lookup for
 * any key should return [None].

Theorem lookup_empty {A} (k : list bool)
  : lookup k (Leaf : binary_trie A) = None.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Define an operation to "insert" a key and optional value
 * into a binary trie. The [insert] definition should satisfy two
 * properties: one is [lookup_insert] below, which says that if we
 * look up a key [k] in a trie where [(k, v)] has just been inserted,
 * the result should be [v]. The other is that lookups on keys different
 * from the one just inserted should be the same as on the original map.
 *
 * If an entry for that key already exists, [insert] should replace
 * that entry with the new one being inserted. Note that [insert] can
 * be used to remove an entry from the trie, too, by inserting [None]
 * as the value.
 *
 * Hint: it may be helpful to define an auxiliary function that inserts
 * a key and optional value into the empty trie.

(* You've reached the end of the problem set. Congrats!
 *
 * If you're up for a completely optional additional challenge,
 * try defining a left-biased merge function below that merges two
 * binary tries, preferring map entries from the first binary trie
 * when an entry exists for both binary tries. Then prove
 * [lookup_left_biased_merge], which formally states that lookups
 * on the merged binary trie operate in exactly this manner.
 *
 * If you don't want to complete this additional challenge, you
 * can just leave everything below unmodified.
