(** * Hoare Logic with Input/Output Traces *)

(* Hoare logic as covered in lecture is only the beginning, so far as
 * programming features that can be supported. In this problem set, we
 * will implement one of variant, a Hoare logic that deals with
 * input/output traces.
 *
 * As we learned in compiler verification, behaviors of a program can be
 * defined as sequences of communications with the outside world. Hoare logic
 * certainly can be used for proving properties about program behaviors.
 * Besides valuation and heap, we will need to keep track of traces of a program
 * to ensure the properties we want, sometimes by proving invariants in the
 * middle of the program.
 *
 * The problem set consists of 4 tasks; basically we ask you to formally prove
 * the correctness of some programs using Hoare logic:
 * 1) To design a big-step operational semantics of the given language.
 * 2) To define a Hoare logic for the language, and to prove the consistency
 *    between the semantics and the logic.
 * 3) To verify three example programs we provide, using Hoare logic.
 * 4) To design your own interesting program and to verify it.
 *)

(** * Language syntax *)

(* There is nothing special with the definitions of [exp] and [bexp]; they are
 * exactly same as we've seen in the lecture.
 *)
Inductive exp :=
| Const (n : nat)
| Var (x : string)
| Read (e1 : exp)
| Plus (e1 e2 : exp)
| Minus (e1 e2 : exp)
| Mult (e1 e2 : exp).

Inductive bexp :=
| Equal (e1 e2 : exp)
| Less (e1 e2 : exp).

(* [heap] and [valuation] are also as usual. *)
Definition heap := fmap nat nat.
Definition valuation := fmap var nat.

(* Besides [heap] and [valuation], we have one more component to verify using
 * Hoare logic, called [io]. We keep track of inputs and outputs of a certain
 * program, regarding them as meaningful communication with the outside world.
 * When a program is executed, it generates [trace], which is a list of [io]s,
 * meaning inputs and outputs that occurred during the execution. Traces are
 * also called behaviors of a program.
 *)
Inductive io := In (v : nat) | Out (v : nat).
Definition trace := list io.

(* We now have two types of assertions: [iassertion] is used only for asserting
 * properties of internal states. [assertion] can be used for asserting
 * properties of [trace]s as well as internal states.
 *)
Definition iassertion := heap -> valuation -> Prop.
Definition assertion := trace -> heap -> valuation -> Prop.

(* [cmd] has more constructors than what we've seen.  The new ones are called
 * [Input] and [Output]. As expected, semantically they generates [io]s,
 * eventually forming a [trace] of a program.
 *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x : var) (e : exp)
| Write (e1 e2 : exp)
| Seq (c1 c2 : cmd)
| If_ (be : bexp) (then_ else_ : cmd)
| While_ (inv : assertion) (be : bexp) (body : cmd)

| Assert (a : iassertion) (* Note that we are using [iassertion], not
                           * [assertion], for [Assert]. While [valuation] and
                           * [heap] are internal states directly manipulated by
                           * a program, [trace] is rather an abstract notion for
                           * defining a behavior of a program.
                           *)

(* The new constructors are below! *)
| Input (x : var) (* [Input] takes an input from the external world and assigns
                   * the value to the local variable [x].
                   *)
| Output (e : exp). (* [Output] prints the value of [e]. *)

(** * Task 1: A big-step operational semantics for commands *)

(* Your first task is to define a big-step operational semantics for commands.
 * While it should be very similar to what we've seen in class, it should
 * also represent something about [io]s (or [trace]). Make sure the semantics
 * captures the effects of [Input]/[Output] on [trace]s. The most
 * recent event should appear at the *front* of the list in the trace.
 *
 * We provide the signature of the big-step semantics below. Replace the
 * [Axiom] below with your own definition of the semantics.
 * The first three arguments are the trace, heap, and valuation before execution,
 * and the final three arguments are the trace, heap, and valuation after execution.
 *)

(** * Define your semantics here! *)

(* 10 points *)
Axiom exec : trace -> heap -> valuation -> cmd ->
             trace -> heap -> valuation -> Prop.


(** * Task 2 : Hoare logic *)

(* We also ask you to define a Hoare logic for our language. The logic should
 * derive triples of the form {{ P }} c {{ Q }}, where "P" and "Q" have type
 * [assertion] and "c" has type [cmd]. It should be also very similar to the
 * Hoare logic we've defined in class.
 *)

(* The logic should be consistent with the semantics you defined, so we
 * also ask you to prove a soundness relation between your Hoare logic and your
 * semantics.  You will need this consistency to prove the correctness of
 * example programs we will provide soon.
 *)

 * theorems. You are required to prove the theorems stated below using Hoare
 * logic.

     done
   else
     when "x" < "z" then

Proof.
Admitted.


(** * Task 4: Implement your own program to verify. *)

(* The last task is to implement your own program and to verify its correctness
 * using Hoare logic. Note that the three examples we provided above had nothing
 * to do with [heap]s. Design a program that uses the heap and loops in a nontrivial
 * manner and prove its correctness.
