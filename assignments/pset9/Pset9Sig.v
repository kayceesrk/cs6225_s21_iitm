(** * Translation Validation of Constant Assignment Code Motion *)

(* In this problem set, we verify an optimization called constant assignment
 * code motion by using verified translation validation.  Instead of proving the
 * correctness of some target optimizations directly, sometimes it is easier to
 * statically check the connection between source and target programs and to say
 * that they are equivalent when they pass the checker. Then we can use an
 * unproven function to make the transformation, so long as it always happens to
 * transform programs into compatible counterparts.  More formally, we
 * can state our high-level goal like below:
 * [forall s t, Validator s t = true -> forall v, (v, s) =| (v, t)]
 *
 * CompCert also actively uses the translation-validation mechanism to verify
 * a number of optimizations. One well-known instance is called lazy code motion
 * (LCM). For details, refer to this article:
 *   http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/publi/validation-LCM.pdf
 *
 * Here we also _formally validate_ the correctness of simple code motion. The
 * target language is exactly same as you've seen in the textbook. We will also
 * use the same semantics and trace-equivalence definitions. *)

  | Const _ => true

(** * A simple loop/branch invariant code motion translator *)

(* [constAssignCodeMotion] lifts some constant-assignment commands. Given a 
 * source program, it returns _a pair of programs_, say (hint, target).  These
 * programs will differ only in the motion of some constant assignments.  To
 * keep the structures of the commands in alignment, we add extra [Nop] markers.
 * For instance, consider this program.
 *  ["x" <- "y"; "z" <- 0]
 * We decide to reorder the two assignments.  To prepare for that reordering, we
 * add an extra "reserved spot" for the "z" assignment, before the "x"
 * assignment.
 *  [     Nop; "x" <- "y"; "z" <- 0]
 * This program is the "hint."  Then the actual motion works as follows, leaving
 * behind a [Nop] for any assignment that was moved.
 *  ["z" <- 0; "x" <- "y"; Nop]
 * This program is the "target."
 *
 * We use [Nop] instead of [Skip] to keep a 1-1 execution correspondence between
 * "hint" and "target".  If [Skip] was used, the correspondence breaks down
 * since [Skip] in a program either stops or moves to the next sequence, while
 * [Nop] and [Assign] make explicit steps to [Skip].
 *
 * Along with the optimization, our validator takes "hint" and "target" as 
 * inputs. In other words, it takes two programs with exactly the same structure
 * except some [Nop]-[Assign] matches. The equivalence between the source 
 * program and "hint" is trivial; certainly we can prove it, but we skip doing
 * so in this problem set. *)
Fixpoint constAssignCodeMotion (c: cmd) :=

    if cmdNotReading c1 ($0 $+ (x, n)) then

 * that change code inside loops! *)

(** * A validator to check code motions are performed correctly *)

(* Now here is our validator. As mentioned above, inputs ([s] and [t]) of 
 * the validator should have the same syntax structure except for 
 * [Nop]-[Assign] and [Assign]-[Nop] cases.
 *
 * [validator'] returns either [Some nmd] if the command pair is valid
 * and [nmd] is the post-maydiff set, and [None] if the command pair
 * is invalid.
