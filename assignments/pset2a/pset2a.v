(* Exercise: direct proof conjunction associative [20 points].
The following definition gives a program that directly proves that conjunction
is associative.  (And it's likely though not certain that it's the same program
you produced in the previous exercise using tactics.)  Rewrite the program so
that it still proves the theorem, but doesn't use a nested pattern match.
Hint: deep pattern matching with conj.

[P <-> Q], which means [(P -> Q) /\ (Q -> P)], i.e., "if and only if" or
"iff".

   notes, and this direction is actually provable in constructive logic. *)

(* Exercise: double negation of excluded middle [30 points].

(* Exercise: xor [40 points].
Define your own inductive type for exclusive or.
Prove that [P] xor [Q] holds iff [(P \/ Q) /\ (~P \/ ~Q)] holds.

Hints:
- The [left] and [right] tactics will work on any inductive type
  with two constructors.
- You will likely need a new tactic [inversion], which is like
  [destruct] except that it will also remember the original
  formula you are destructing, keeping that formula as part of the
  assumptions.

 * Proofs are Programs [60 points].
 *)

(*
For the following prove them by directly writing down the Coq program that is
the proof, rather than using tactics to help construct the proof.
  (A -> B) -> ((B -> C) -> (A -> C))
  A -> (A \/ B)
  B -> (A \/ B)
  (A -> C) -> ((B -> C) -> ((A \/ B) -> C))
  A /\ B -> A
  A /\ B -> B
  (C -> A) -> ((C -> B) -> (C -> (A /\ B)))
  (A -> (B -> C)) -> ((A /\ B) -> C)
  ((A /\ B) -> C) -> (A -> (B -> C))
  (A /\ ~A) -> B
  (A -> (A /\ ~A)) -> ~A
  A -> (A -> B) -> B

Here's an example of what we mean, using the first proposition
from above:
*)

Definition example : forall A B C : Prop,
  (A -> B) -> ((B -> C) -> (A -> C))
:=
  fun (A B C : Prop) (ab : A -> B) (bc : B -> C) (a : A) =>
    bc (ab a).

(* You will need to use pattern matching for proofs/programs involving
   conjunction, disjunction, and negation.  Specifically, [conj] will
   be useful for conjunction, [or_introl] and [or_intror] for disjunction,
   and [not] and [False_rect] for negation.  You can review those
   by examing the output of these: *)

Print and.
Print or.
Print not.
Print False_rect.
