(* In this problem set, we will work with the following simple imperative language with
 * a nondeterministic choice operator. Your task is to define both big-step as well as
 * a particular kind of small-step operational semantics for this language
 * (one that is in fact deterministic), and to prove a theorem connecting the two:
 * if the small-step semantics aborts, then the big-step semantics may abort.
 *
 * This is the first problem set so far in this class that is truly open-ended.
 * We want to give you the flexibility to define the operational semantics as
 * you wish, and if you'd like you may even differ from the template shown here
 * if you find it more convenient.
 * Additionally, this is the first problem set where it is *NOT* sufficient to
 * just get the file compiling without any use of [admit] or [Admitted].
 * This will not necessarily guarantee that you have given reasonable semantics
 * for the programming language, and accordingly, will not necessarily
 * guarantee that you will earn full credit. For instance, if you define
 * your small-step semantics as the empty relation (which is incorrect),
 * the theorem you must prove to connect your big-step and small-step
 * semantics will be trivial.

(** * Syntax *)

(* Basic arithmetic expressions, as we've seen several times in class. *)
Inductive arith : Set :=
| Const : nat -> arith
| Var : var -> arith
| Plus : arith -> arith -> arith
| Eq : arith -> arith -> arith
(* should return 1 if the two expressions are equal, and 0 otherwise. *)
| Lt : arith -> arith -> arith
(* should return 1 if the first expression is less than then second, and 0 otherwise. *)
.

(* The simple imperative language with a [Choose] syntax for
 * nondeterminism. The intended meaning of the program
 * [Choose c c'] is that either [c] should run or [c'] should run.
 *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Assign : var -> arith -> cmd
| Skip : cmd
| Seq : cmd -> cmd -> cmd
| Choose : cmd -> cmd -> cmd (* Here's the main novelty: nondeterministic choice *)
| If : arith -> cmd (* then *) -> cmd (* else *) -> cmd
| While : arith -> cmd -> cmd
| Abort : cmd (* This command should immediately terminate the program *)
.

(* No matter the value of [num_iters], [test_prog2 num_iters]

 * expression language.

  | Const n => n

(** ** Part 1: Big-step operational semantics *)

(* You should define some result type (say, [result]) for values that commands
   in the language run to, and define a big-step operational semantics
   [eval : valuation -> cmd -> result -> Prop]
   that says when a program *may* run to some result in *some* nondeterministic
   realization of the program. Then you should also define a predicate
   [big_aborted : result -> Prop]
   that describes which results indicate that the program aborted.
 *)

  (** ** Part 2: Small-step deterministic operational semantics *)

(* Next, you should define a small-step operational semantics for this
   language that in some sense tries to run *all* possible nondeterministic
   realizations and aborts if any possible realization aborts.
   Define a type [state] that represents the underlying state that the
   small-step semantics should take steps on, and then define a small-step
   semantics
   [step : state -> state -> Prop]
   .

   Here's the twist: we ask that you define an operational semantics that
   is *deterministic*, in the sense of the following formal statement:
   [forall s1 s2 s2', step s1 s2 -> step s1 s2' -> s2 = s2'].

   The operational model that we have in mind in this: when we encounter
   a nondeterministic choice, we execute the left branch. If the left
   branch terminates without aborting, we backtrack and try the
   other nondeterministic choice.

   Note that if any possible realization does not terminate,
   we allow the deterministic small-step semantics to diverge as well.
   (It is actually possible to define a semantics that always "finds" aborts,
   even if some branches of nondeterminism diverge!  However, the proof of that
   variant would likely be significantly more complicated, and we haven't tried
   it ourselves.)

   Define a function
   [init : valuation -> cmd -> state]
   that builds starting states for the small-step semantics,
   a predicate
   [small_aborted : state -> Prop]
   that describes which states are considered aborted, and
   a predicate
   [small_terminated : state -> Prop]
   that describes states that have run to completion without any
   nondeterministic branch aborting.

(** ** Part 4: Connection between big- and small-step semantics *)

(* Prove the following theorem demonstrating the connection between the big-step
 * and small-step semantics:
 *
 * If the small-step semantics aborts, then the big-step semantics may
 * potentially abort.
 *)

(* 40 points *)
Theorem small_abort_big_may_abort : forall v c s,

Proof.
Admitted.

 (* As an additional challenge, you  you may want to prove the following
 * theorem. Note that this is *NOT* required for this assignment and
 * will not affect your grade.
 *
 * If the small-step semantics terminates without aborting, then the
 * big-step semantics may *not* abort.
 *)

(*

       forall v c s,
         step^* (init v c) s
